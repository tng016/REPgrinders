## Introdution
 - What is Kubernetes?

    - Kubernetes, at its basic level, is a system for running and coordinating containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It is a platform designed to completely manage the life cycle of containerized applications and services using methods that provide predictability, scalability, and high availability.

    - As a Kubernetes user, you can define how your applications should run and the ways they should be able to interact with other applications or the outside world. You can scale your services up or down, perform graceful rolling updates, and switch traffic between different versions of your applications to test features or rollback problematic deployments. Kubernetes provides interfaces and composable platform primitives that allow you to define and manage your applications with high degrees of flexibility, power, and reliability.


## Kubernetes Objects

  - Kubernetes contains a number of abstractions that represent the state of your system: deployed containerized applications and workloads, their associated network and disk resources, and other information about what your cluster is doing. These abstractions are represented by objects in the Kubernetes API. See Understanding Kubernetes Objects for more details.

    - The basic Kubernetes objects include:

        -  Pod
        -  Service
        -  Volume
        -  Namespace

    - ## Pod

        - A pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers (such as Docker containers), with shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers.
    
    - ## Replica Set

        - A Replica Set ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. In other words, a Replica Set makes sure that a pod or a homogeneous set of pods is always up and available. A Replica set help you to define how many pods are available. If you define replica as three, then one pod die, the Replica Set create a pod to make it three.

    - ## Deployment

        - A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.You describe a desired state in a Deployment object, and the Deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments. A Deployment include Pod(s) and Replica Set. It also help to update the resources when you deploy new version.

    - ## Service

        - A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them - sometimes called a micro-service. If you create a pod, you don’t know where it is. Also, a pod might be killed by someone or some shortage of a node. Service provide an endpoint of the pods for you. If you specify “type=LoadBalancer” it actually create an Azure Load Balancer to expose pod with Public IP address.

    - ## Storage Class

        - A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the “classes” of storage they offer. It represent a Persistent Volume like Azure Disk or Azure File or some other storage.

    - ## Persistent Volume Claim

        - Presistent Volume Claim is the abstruction of the Persistent Volume. Persistent Volume is physical resources of inflastructure. Kubernetes want to hide the detail from developers. Using Persistent Volume Claim, you can hide the physical declaration defined by Persistent Volume or Storage Class. Pod can mount the Volume using Persistent Volume Claim object.

## Kubernetes Architecture

 - To understand how Kubernetes is able to provide these capabilities, it is helpful to get a sense of how it is designed and organized at a high level. Kubernetes can be visualized as a system built in layers, with each higher layer abstracting the complexity found in the lower levels.

 - At its base, Kubernetes brings together individual physical or virtual machines into a cluster using a shared network to communicate between each server. This cluster is the physical platform where all Kubernetes components, capabilities, and workloads are configured.

 - The machines in the cluster are each given a role within the Kubernetes ecosystem. One server (or a small group in highly available deployments) functions as the master server. This server acts as a gateway and brain for the cluster by exposing an API for users and clients, health checking other servers, deciding how best to split up and assign work (known as “scheduling”), and orchestrating communication between other components. The master server acts as the primary point of contact with the cluster and is responsible for most of the centralized logic Kubernetes provides.

 - The other machines in the cluster are designated as nodes: servers responsible for accepting and running workloads using local and external resources. To help with isolation, management, and flexibility, Kubernetes runs applications and services in containers, so each node needs to be equipped with a container runtime (like Docker or rkt). The node receives work instructions from the master server and creates or destroys containers accordingly, adjusting networking rules to route and forward traffic appropriately.

 - As mentioned above, the applications and services themselves are run on the cluster within containers. The underlying components make sure that the desired state of the applications matches the actual state of the cluster. Users interact with the cluster by communicating with the main API server either directly or with clients and libraries. To start up an application or service, a declarative plan is submitted in JSON or YAML defining what to create and how it should be managed. The master server then takes the plan and figures out how to run it on the infrastructure by examining the requirements and the current state of the system. This group of user-defined applications running according to a specified plan represents Kubernetes’ final layer.
